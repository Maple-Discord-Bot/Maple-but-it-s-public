### How it began
* The bot started as a hobby project for my school server. As I upgrade it on and on, my friend also invited the bot to their  servers too! This bot now has a lot of functions to help and assist with your server! With frequent updates every week, more useful features will be added with a dashboard website coming soon to help configure the bot to help with your server!

### A very detailed description
* The Bot's function can be easily divided into 6 categories. The first category contains normal utility stuff that is very helpful for your everyday use such as starting a poll or a calculator and much more! Next is the fun command where you can use it to mess around with your friends! This bot can also manipulate images with funny effects! Feeling bored? This bot also includes built-in mini-games you can play with your friends! To those fellas who like money and economy stuff, well we got stuff for you too! We have a global balance system that works across all the servers that this bot is in (You can rob people! Yay?). Does the bot feel boring? Not to worry cause this bot is also connected to the internet! You can search for pictures! Lookup stuff on Wikipedia and display the result for all your friends to see together! This bot can play music on voice channels too! (If you want?) Last but not least is the danger zone, the moderation zone! Keep your server safe with a warning system and more! (More to come with dashboard website update)

### Other 
* This bot is hosted on a paid VPS and will most of the time be online
* This bot is also coded in python for people who are wondering
* The bot is made by a team of 3 people with Flooffen#1175 as the project lead
